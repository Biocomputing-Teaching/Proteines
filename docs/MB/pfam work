#pfam tutorial
In order to do a perform a sequence of a protein:

1-Use the website : pfam-legacy.xfam.org
![](Pfam%20link%20.png)

2- Choose a specific protein in PDB ( protein data bank ) ![](Protein%20data%20bank%20pic.png)

3- Select FASTA sequence from display files on the top
4- Batch sequence search
5- Put the FASTA sequence in sequence file
![](FASTA%20sequence%20.png)
6- Paste FASTA sequence in search box, press and submit it

7- You find Significant PFAM-A-matches

HMM length is Hidden Markov Moldel, it is a statistical model
HMM length: (specific number) amino acids long
The E-value or the excpect value, this is similar to what is found in blast research, the smaller E value , the better the alignment quality

In the top, there is HMM residue 

In the bottom , you find amino acid sequence 
Color coded has a significance. Green means 100% and red 0% of matching
