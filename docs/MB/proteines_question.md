# Let's consider a protein 4hhb and 1mbo. By relying on Chimera,
1. How many chains are present in each protein  ? ( Color them in PDB format ) 
1. Identify the secondary strucutres of each protein.
1. What are the all nonstandard residues present in each protein and mention them.
1. Identify hydrogen bonds using Chimera ( between side chains and Helices) and save them in PDB format.
1. Find FASTA sequence for each protein.
Select two atoms from each protein and measure the distance.
Compare the sequences of two proteins ( Structure Comparison>Match>Align).
Find the percentage identity for each protein.
Save the whole process in PDB format.
