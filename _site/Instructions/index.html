<ol>
  <li>How many chains are present in each protein  ? ( Color them in PDB format )</li>
  <li>Identify the secondary strucutres of each protein.</li>
  <li>What are the all nonstandard residues present in each protein and mention them.</li>
  <li>Identify hydrogen bonds using Chimera ( between side chains and Helices) and save them in PDB format.</li>
  <li>Find FASTA sequence for each protein.
Select two atoms from each protein and measure the distance.
Compare the sequences of two proteins ( Structure Comparison&gt;Match&gt;Align).
Find the percentage identity for each protein.
Save the whole process in PDB format.
