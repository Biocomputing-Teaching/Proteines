<p>Letâ€™s work on a protein called 3LK2 based on Protein Data Bank.
Crystal structure of CapZ bound to the uncapping motif from CARMIL.
Classification: Protein binding.
According to SCOP classification (Structural Classification of Proteins):
It is a multi-domain protein containing both alpha and beta.
Family is alpha 1 capZ
The biochemical function of the protein is based on PROTEIN BINDING.
The Biological Process is based on performing the cell junction assembly.
The protein contains three chains : Chain A, B and T.
